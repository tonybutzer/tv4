    "Sure! Here’s the text formatted with bullet points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear perception of reality**: Including a heightened ability to detect falseness and be a good judge of character.\n",
    "- **Acceptance**: Of themselves and things as they are.\n",
    "- **Spontaneity**: A rich, unconventional inner life with a child-like ability to constantly see the world anew and appreciate beauty in the mundane.\n",
    "- **Problem-centeredness**: Focus on questions or challenges outside themselves—a sense of mission or purpose—resulting in an absence of pettiness, introspection, and ego games.\n",
    "- **Solitude seeking**: Enjoyed for its own sake; solitude also brings serenity and detachment from misfortune/crisis, and allows for independence of thought and decision.\n",
    "- **Autonomy**: Independence of the good opinion of other people; more interest in inner satisfaction than status or rewards.\n",
    "- **Peak or mystical experiences**: Experiences when time seems to stand still.\n",
    "- **Human kinship**: A genuine love for, and desire to help, all people.\n",
    "- **Humility and respect**: Belief that we can learn from anyone, and that even the worst person has redeeming features.\n",
    "- **Ethics**: Clear, if not conventional, notions of right and wrong.\n",
    "- **Sense of humor**: Not amused by jokes that hurt or imply inferiority, but humor that highlights the foolishness of human beings in general.\n",
    "- **Creativity**: Not the Mozart type of genius that is inborn, but in all that is done, said, or acted.\n",
    "- **Resistance to enculturation**: Ability to see beyond the confines of culture and era.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to adjust the formatting if you need it for a specific purpose!"
